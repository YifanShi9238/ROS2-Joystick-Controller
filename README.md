# ROS2-Joystick-Controller
The `lightning_talk_demo branch` is built for quick demostration and try out by any new-to-ROS2 developer with a controller that is compatible with the underlying operation system, typically Linux (playstation, xbox, etc) on joy package functionality on ROS2.  

## System Requirement
This codebase is developed under **ROS2 Jazzy Jalisco** with **Python version 3.12**. To install ROS2 Jazzy, follow the installation steps in [ROS2 Jazzy Installation Official Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation.html)

## Quick Start
<pre>git clone https://github.com/YifanShi9238/ROS2-Joystick-Controller.git
cd ROS2-Joystick-Controller
git checkout lightning_talk_demo
colcon build && . install/setup.bash</pre>

## Demo 1: Joystick Listener demo
After plugged in controller, check usb connection of your controller by typing.
<pre>```lsusb</pre>
